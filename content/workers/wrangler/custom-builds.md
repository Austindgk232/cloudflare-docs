# Custom builds

Wrangler provides a capable development environment for a large number of use cases. Sometimes, developers might want to customize how their code is compiled, before being processed by Wrangler. This document describes why you would want to create a custom build, and how custom builds fit together with `wrangler dev` and `wrangler publish`.
